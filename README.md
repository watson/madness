# madness

unix + node = &lt;3

There is really no point in this. Expect to showcase how awesome Node.js can be when running on a UNIX box :)

Half the code it just to make you feel nice when you feast on the output. The other half is whitespace and finally a little piping to add flavor.

## Usage

1. Install it using `npm install -g madness`
2. Run it using `madness`
3. ???
4. Profit

MIT (yep!)
